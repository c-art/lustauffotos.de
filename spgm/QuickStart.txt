        - AN SPGM QUICK START GUIDE -


I have been given the advice to provide very impatient users with a quick 
start guide. So there it is !
Note that the following instructions are not intended for webmasters-beginners.
So if you can't work it out using this, please refer to the complete guide 
(Install.txt).


1. unzip spgm-xxx.zip and upload spgm/ in your www virtual directory 
2. under spgm/gal/, create your own directory spgm/gal/firstgal/ to hold 
   your first image collection 
3. copy your image my-picture.jpg into spgm/gal/firstgal/ 
4. make a thumbnail called _thb_my-picture.jpg in spgm/gal/firstgal/
   (MANDATORY)
5. Type gallery caption and save to gal-desc.txt in spgm/gal/firstgal/
   (OPTIONAL)
6. Type picture caption ('my-picture.jpg = my first caption') 
   and save to pic-desc.txt in spgm/gal/firstgal/ (OPTIONAL)
